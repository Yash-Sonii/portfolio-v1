export const HERO_CONTENT = `Aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a passion for turning ideas into clean, functional web applications. I’m deeply immersed in learning modern tools like React, Next.js, and Node.js, while building projects to solidify my understanding of databases (MySQL, MongoDB) and full-stack workflows. Every day, I focus on sharpening my skills in [specific area, e.g., REST APIs, responsive design, state management] and embracing best practices. I’m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the thrill of seeing code come to life.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I see coding and chess as deeply connected—both demand strategy, foresight, and the ability to navigate an infinite number of possibilities to reach a goal. Every move, whether in code or on the board, opens new paths, new challenges, and new opportunities. The only difference is that in chess, you can’t revert a move, but in coding, you have the power to experiment, debug, and refine until you craft the perfect solution. That’s what excites me the most coding gives you the freedom to create, innovate, and shape the world around you.My goal is to not just be a developer, but a creator—someone who builds, innovates, and continuously evolves in this ever-changing world of technology.`;
